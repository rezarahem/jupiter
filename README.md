# Jupiter

Jupiter is an in-progress CLI tool designed to simplify the process of deploying modern web applications.

## Prerequisites

1. **A VPS running Ubuntu 24.04**

    Ubuntu 22.04 should work as well, though it hasn't been tested.

2. **A domain name with properly configured DNS settings pointing to the VPS**

    Using Cloudflare's DNS service is recommended, as it also provides DDoS attack protection.
